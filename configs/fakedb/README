fakedb is used for basic testing of the datageneration system. It's
relatively small and builds in a few minutes. If you want to build
more than the first few chunks, remove the -r "0:2000", but this is
unlikely to fit on most computers.

To build it (requires replicator on localhost):
  cd dax_data_generator
  bin/run_distribserver.sh -glocalhost -r "0:2000"

To build it, skipping data ingest with the replicator:
  cd dax_data_generator
  bin/run_distribserver.sh -glocalhost -k -r "0:2000"
