fakedb is used for basic testing of the datageneration system. It's
relatively small and builds in a few minutes.

To build it:
  Set the system up according to dax_data_generator/README.md, then:
    cd dax_data_generator
    python bin/makevisits.py -o configs/fakedb/pregenerated/visit_table.csv
    python bin/datagenserver.py -c configs/fakedb/serverCfg.yml
