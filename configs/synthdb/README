synthdb should be exactly the same as fakedb but with a different
'transaction_size' in serverCfg.yml than fakedb. When built
and installed both synthdb and fakedb must have the same number
of Objects and other database elements.

To build it (requires replicator on localhost):
  cd dax_data_generator
  bin/run_distribserver.sh synthdb -glocalhost -r "0:2000"

To build it, skipping data ingest with the replicator:
  cd dax_data_generator
  bin/run_distribserver.sh synthdb -glocalhost -k -r "0:2000"


Make sure stripes and substripes are consistent:
grep -R stripe
grep -R overlap
