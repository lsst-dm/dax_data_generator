This directory contains configuration files for the partitioner. 
Files that end in '.cfg' will be copied from the server to the worker.
The clients will generate data files for the tables that have 
configuration files in this directory. 

If fakeGenSpec.py defines tables "Object", "CcdVisit" and "ForcedSource" 
This directory will need  files "Object.cfg" and "ForcedSource.cfg" files. 
This will keep "CcdVisit" from being ingested into the final database.
